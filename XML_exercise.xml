# I had initially created two seperate categories like tables and each book for cookery and technical under each.
# But, having reviewed the slides again, I decided to add the category after each book as the attribute category.
# I chose to add the ISBN, Title and Author as the child attributes and use Category within the book attribute to differentiate based on what was asked in the exercise.
